### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kyle Glover and I am a **Software Developer** and part-time
**Data Enthusiast** from Melbourne AUS and have experience in building backend
services, data pipelines, and machine learning models. I tinker with technology
to know how things work, but it can be harder to put it back together.
